   TEST 2: Let Bindings and Infix Operators as Functions
   =====================================================
   
   Testing intention:
   - Verify let binding variable definition and scoping
   - Test multiplication operator (*) used as a function
   - Validate partial application of binary operators
   - Ensure variable substitution in expressions
   
   This test ensures:
   1. Let bindings work correctly
   2. Infix operators can be used in function position
   3. Variable references resolve to bound values
   4. Order of operations with function application
   
   Expected result: 20 (10 * 2)

let x = 10 in (*) x 2 -- Multiply bound variable by constant
