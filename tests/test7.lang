   TEST 7: Division by Zero Error Handling
   =====================================
   
   Testing intention:
   - Test runtime error detection for division by zero
   - Verify error messages are properly generated
   - Test that computation leading to zero divisor is handled
   - Validate error propagation in arithmetic operations
   
   This test ensures:
   1. Division by zero is detected at runtime
   2. Appropriate error messages are generated
   3. Computed zero values (not just literal 0) trigger errors
   4. Error handling doesn't crash the interpreter
   5. Mathematical edge cases are properly handled
   
   Expected result: Error: Division by zero

let numerator = 10 in      -- Valid dividend
let denominator = (-) 5 5 in  -- Computed zero: 5 - 5 = 0
    (/) numerator denominator  -- Should trigger division by zero error
