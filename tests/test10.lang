   TEST 10: Infinite Recursion and Stack Overflow Detection
   =======================================================
   
   Testing intention:
   - Test detection of infinite recursive calls
   - Verify stack overflow protection mechanisms
   - Test that interpreter doesn't crash on infinite loops
   - Validate error handling for runaway recursion
   
   This test ensures:
   1. Infinite recursion is detected before stack exhaustion
   2. Appropriate error messages are generated for stack overflow
   3. Interpreter remains stable after detecting infinite recursion
   4. Stack depth limits are enforced
   5. Error recovery allows continuation after recursion errors
   
   Expected result: Error: Stack overflow due to infinite recursion
