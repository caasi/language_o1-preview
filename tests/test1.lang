   TEST 1: Basic Lambda Functions and Currying
   ==========================================
   
   Testing intention:
   - Verify lambda function definition with explicit syntax (\ x . body)
   - Test function currying (two-argument function as nested lambdas)
   - Validate function application with correct argument passing
   - Test basic arithmetic operator usage in functional style
   
   This test ensures:
   1. Lambda syntax parsing works correctly
   2. Curried functions can be defined and called
   3. Built-in operators like (+) work as functions
   4. Function application evaluates in correct order
   
   Expected result: 5 (2 + 3)

let add = \ x . \ y . (+) x y in add 2 3 -- Two-argument addition via currying
