   TEST 3: Variable Reuse and Self-Reference
   =========================================
   
   Testing intention:
   - Test same variable used multiple times in expression
   - Verify variable scoping doesn't create conflicts
   - Validate that bound variables can reference themselves multiple times
   - Ensure correct evaluation when variable appears as both operands
   
   This test ensures:
   1. Variables can be used multiple times in same expression
   2. No scoping conflicts when variable appears twice
   3. Correct substitution when same variable is both operands
   4. Mathematical operations work with repeated variables
   
   Expected result: 4 (2 * 2)

let x = 2 in (*) x x -- Square a number (multiply by itself)
