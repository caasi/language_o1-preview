   TEST 15: Nested Constructor Applications and ADT Composition
   ==========================================================
   
   Testing intention:
   - Test constructor functions with arguments
   - Verify nested constructor applications (constructor of constructor)
   - Test ADT composition and value wrapping
   - Validate complex data structure creation
   
   This test ensures:
   1. Constructor functions can take arguments
   2. Constructors can be nested (Just containing Success)
   3. ADT values can be composed together
   4. Constructor application works with complex expressions
   5. Nested data structures print correctly
   
   Expected result: Just (Success (100))

let Just = \ x . Just# x in      -- Maybe type constructor
let Success = \ x . Success# x in -- Result type constructor  
let res = Just (Success 100) in res -- Nested: Maybe (Result Int)
