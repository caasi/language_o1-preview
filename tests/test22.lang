   TEST 22: Comment Integration with All Language Features
   =====================================================
   
   Testing intention:
   - Test that comments work correctly with all major language features
   - Verify comments don't interfere with parsing or evaluation
   - Test both single-line and multi-line comments in complex expressions
   - Validate comment placement doesn't affect semantics
   
   This test ensures:
   1. Comments work with lambda expressions
   2. Comments work with let bindings
   3. Comments work with case expressions  
   4. Comments work with constructor applications
   5. Nested comments don't break complex expressions
   6. Comments are completely ignored during evaluation
   
   Expected result: 42 (regardless of comments)

let {- comment in let binding -} add = \ x . -- comment after lambda
    \ y . (+) x y {- inline comment in lambda body -} in  
let {- nested {- comment -} here -} result = add 40 2 in  -- direct application instead of case
-- Final comment before result
result -- Expected: 42
