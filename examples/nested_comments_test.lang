   Nested Comments Test
   ===================
   
   This tests GHC-style nested multi-line comments.
   
   Intention: Support proper nesting of multi-line comments,
   which is a key feature of GHC Haskell comments.
   
   {- 
      First level of nesting - comments can contain other comments
      {- 
         Second level of nesting - this should work too
         {- 
            Third level - even deeper nesting should be handled correctly
         -}
         Back to second level
      -}
      Back to first level
   -}
   
   Why nested comments matter:
   - Allows commenting out large blocks of code that already contain comments
   - Enables hierarchical documentation structure
   - Prevents issues when temporarily disabling commented code
-}

-- The actual executable code starts here
-- Expected result: 15
let result = 15 in
  result
end

{-
   Post-code comment block
   
   This demonstrates that multi-line comments work at the end of files too.
   The nesting counter should properly track all opening/closing pairs.
