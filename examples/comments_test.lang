   GHC-Style Comments Test
   ======================
   
   This file tests the GHC-style comment syntax implementation.
   
   Intentions:
   1. Provide clear documentation within code
   2. Support both single-line and multi-line comments
   3. Allow comments to be placed anywhere in the code
   4. Enable code commenting for debugging and development
   
   Expected behavior:
   - All comments should be completely ignored by the lexer
   - Code execution should work exactly as if comments weren't there
   - This expression should evaluate to 5 (just the variable x)
-}

let x = 5 in  -- Single-line comments start with '--' and go to end of line
  {- Multi-line comments use {- ... -} and can span multiple lines -}
  x  -- We return just x (value 5), not x + 2, to test comment parsing
end

-- Single-line comments can appear at the end of files
-- They are useful for:
-- - Explaining code behavior
-- - Temporarily disabling code
-- - Adding development notes
